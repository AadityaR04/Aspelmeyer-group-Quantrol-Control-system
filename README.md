# Quantrol

Quantrol is a high level solution built on top of the open access Artiq infrastructure. It allows researchers to use most of the Artiq features without coding.
The current state of the GUI is adopted for the specific hardware used in Hosten group at Institure of Science and Technology Austria. However, it can be relatively easily adopted for any type of Sinara based hardware.

## License
This is an open source project that was developed for the use in Hosten group (https://hostenlab.pages.ist.ac.at/). It was made public as we believed that other groups might benefit from what we have built.
Please keep in mind that there might still be minor bugs. We would appreciate your input on making Quantrol better.
