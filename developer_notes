This file contains the developer notes about problems and potential soltions that developers might want to implement in future.



- After the rework the program is using the artiq_master to start a server and submit experiments to scheduler. Current implementation of stop_continuous_run is looking for the last RID from the last_rid.pyon and gracefully terminates the experiment with the last_rid. However, if someone has scheduled continuous_run several times there is no way of interrupting the continuous run. 

- The logger of the program is semi correct. One needs to look into the stages of the experiment and make sure that it passes all 8 stages in order to make sure that experiment was executed properly. Apart from that some error messages are still appearing in the terminal of vscode. One can also use artiq_dashboard in order to get access to more logging provided by GUI. One can try to understand and redirect the logging to our GUI in the similar manner.


- saving default will save the entire experiment object that is a bit redundant and loading will reassign only relevant arguments.
